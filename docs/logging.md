# Logs

## Audit Logs
- Audit logs are logs that are generated by the system to keep track of the activities of the users in the database.
- You can track the audit log table in supabase. Sometimes the audit logs appear on the web page as well.
- The audit log table is named `audit_logs`.

## Error Box Messages
- This is another way of showing errors to the developers.
- The error box messages are shown in the bottom left corner of the web page.
- Note that the error box messages are unhandled errors that are caught by the error boundary.

## Console Logs
- Console logs on the server side will be shown in the terminal.
- Console logs on the client side will be shown in the browser console.

## CloudWatch Logs
- CloudWatch logs are logs generated by a Winston logger that is used in the server. 
- The logs are sent to Amazon CloudWatch.
- The function `logErrorReturnLogId` returns a log id that can be used to track the logs in CloudWatch.
- Note that if you are running the server locally, the logs will not be sent to CloudWatch, instead will be printed in the terminal.
